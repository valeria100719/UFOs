# UFOs

## Overview of Project

In this project I assisted Dana in creating a visually appealing web page made up of this data, using some Java data.
Our job was to create a web page containing articles on UFOs, users of the web portal could filter the results by date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results

### How the Web Page works

The web page, like any website, contains a title, a header and images.
Sideways It is possible to find the article about UFOs, under the article it is possible to find a table.
This table can be used by users to filter results, using different parameters (one at a time or multiple at a time)
There are several criteria by which users can filter UFO sightings: date, city, state, country and shape.
Users can filter by as many criteria as they want. Obviously the more criteria are used during a single search, the more stringent the result will be.
The parameters can be deleted and changed at any time, the results of the table are updated with.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

The automaticity of the filters could confuse users,with this program, in fact, the table is updated in real time and the results are shown automatically. Furthermore, there is no real "Menu" button that is normally found at the top of the web page. The "Menu" button should be a "windows" in the website option actions.

### Recommendations

The first tip is to add buttons for "Apply" and "Clear" the filters. Moreove, I would prefer a "Menu" button that allows you to select what to do on the web site. Finally I would add a button that allow users to connect directly to the site of the article source.
